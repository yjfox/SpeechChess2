Speech Application- Gomoku

1. Brief: 
* Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game. Also called Gobang or Five in a Row, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board with 19x19 intersections; however, because once placed, pieces are not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game is known in several countries under different names. Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (Reference from wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku).
* This is a desktop application with speech control. Users should speak two numbers as indicating X coordinate value and Y coordinate value. Two players place their chess pieces in turn. Finally, program will detect who is winner if there is an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

* Speech Lib: using Microsoft Speech Lib 5.4, this program may require to use the windows speech assistant, which shows as 

* Gomoku: Storing the chess placement into a two dimensional array (0 means no chess this position, 1 means chess existing this position).
